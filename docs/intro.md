The web-map custom element suite provides a Web map viewer 'widget' which is modelled somewhat after the HTML5 `<video>` tag: a fairly simple way to get started publishing Web content of the mapping variety.  If you're familiar with that HTML `<video>` developer and user experience you may find developing with and using the web-map custom element suite familiar.

For example, markup such as this:

```html
<mapml-viewer projection="CBMTILE" zoom="3" lat="62.7" lon="-90.3" controls>
  <layer- label="CBMT" src="https://geogratis.gc.ca/mapml/en/cbmtile/cbmt/" checked></layer->
  <layer- label="Restaurants" src="demo/restaurants.mapml" checked></layer->
  <layer- label="Canada's Provinces and Territories" src="demo/canada.mapml" checked></layer->
</mapml-viewer>
```

can be used to create a map like this:
