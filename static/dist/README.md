# &lt;mapml-viewer&gt; custom element

![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/Maps4HTML/Web-Map-Custom-Element.svg?branch=master)
![Continuous Testing](https://github.com/Maps4HTML/Web-Map-Custom-Element/workflows/Continuous%20Testing/badge.svg)

The `<mapml-viewer>` custom element is a prototype implementation of the
[`<map>` media element](https://maps4html.org/MapML/spec/#web-maps)
defined in the MapML (Map Markup Language)
[specification](https://maps4html.org/MapML/spec/).

<!-- ## Installation -->

## Usage

The HTML author can add MapML
sources (layers) by specifying one or more `<layer->` custom elements as
children of `<mapml-viewer>`.

The map provides a default set of controls which are turned on or off with the
map's `controls` boolean attribute.

The `width` and `height` attributes of the map should be specified,
and can be overriden using CSS properties.

The initial zoom and location of the map are controlled by the `zoom`,
`lat` and `lon` attributes.
The default `projection` is `OSMTILE` (Web Mercator).

### Example markup of a basic map

```html
<mapml-viewer zoom="3" lat="0" lon="0" width="800" height="400" controls>
  <layer- src="https://geogratis.gc.ca/mapml/en/osmtile/osm/" label="OpenStreetMap" checked></layer->
</mapml-viewer>
```

### Styling the map element

It is recommended to use the
[`:defined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:defined)
pseudo-class to progressively style the map element.
It ensures styles only apply in
[browsers that support custom elements](https://caniuse.com/custom-elementsv1).

```css
mapml-viewer:defined {
  background-color: black; /* custom background color */
  border: none; /* remove default border */
  max-width: 100%; /* responsive map */
}
```

## A parallel customized built-in element

The `<map is="web-map">` customized built-in element is developed in parallel
to the `<mapml-viewer>` autonomous custom element.
Please note that `<map>` as a customized built-in element has proven to have
a critical [accessibility issue](https://github.com/w3c/html-aam/issues/292)
in some browsers, which causes screen readers not to announce any of the map
element's content,
it is therefore recommended not to use `<map is="web-map">` in production.
